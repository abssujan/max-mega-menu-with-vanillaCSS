# max mega-menu with vanilla css

## Description

I create a max mega menu. I used simple HTML CSS and JS. I wanted to make it fully responsive. I did that but I skip the hover-drop menu for the laptop and tab version.  when you hover the product  nav tag the sub menu will transform form left.

* I faced a major problem to make this navigation bar with the opacity.

I'm trying to hide a submenu by making it transparent (opacity '0'). The submenu should only appear when I hover over a product. However, I'm facing a problem where the empty space of the submenu still remains, even though it's invisible. I've come up with a few solutions, but I'm curious to learn about the different ways people have solved this particular issue.
